### Additional Preparations for Development
If you plan on doing development of drivers/scripts, there's an additional step required after cloning/downloading/installing these files. You must then also run the *npm install* command from within the *script* directory to download and install any development dependencies, as specified by the package.json file. If such dependencies are not installed, you may get TypeScript compilation errors.
